The purpose of the Paypal Cart plugin is to provide you with a quick and easy way to add a Purchase function to individual posts.

== Description ==

For bloggers who want to post items that are for sale in their blogs, Paypal Cart is the solution that provides a quick and easy way to create a Purchase button only on specific posts.  Unlike other plugins, Paypal Cart is very simple to use and does one thing and one thing only.

For each post that a blogger wants to append with the Paypal Cart, a simple metabox is provided that includes the item price, a shipping and handling charge (optional) and an inventory (number of items available).  When the inventory is "1" of more, the Paypal Cart box appears in the post along with a purchase link that takes a user into the Paypal commerce system.  

The Settings interface is where the blogger sets their Paypal email address, determines which of 16 different currencies they accept. They can also optionally modify the css associated with the box to make the  WP Cart for Paypal fit their style.

When an item is sold, the blogger enters "Sold" or "Sold Out" in the inventory box and the item is displayed as Sold and the Purchase button is no longer visible.


== Installation ==

Install WP Cart for Paypal as you do most plugins:

Upload `WP_PayPal_cart.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory and activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q.  How much does it cost to use WP Cart for Paypal?
A.  The only charges are those that you incur by using Paypal.  You can help support the plugin donating money.  There's a link on the Settings page.

Q.  Can I point WP Cart for Paypal at another commerce vendor?
A.  Not at this time.

Q.  I have some ideas for features.  Who do I contact?
A.  Send an email to mike@Human80.com.  

Q.  I would like the function to appear on main index pages of my blog, not just the is_single() pages.
A.  In testing, we found that there are some templates that disable the CSS when it appears on index pages.  Until we find a solution for that, the WP Cart for Paypal box can only appear on is_single() pages.

Q.  I want to feature more than one price per item.  How do I do that?
A.  Since Paypal Cart links purchases into the Paypal shopping cart function, site visitors can order more than one of an item by clicking the Purchase button multiple times.

2. This is how the default Paypal Cart shows up in a blog post.
